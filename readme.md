## gophoto - A Photo Archive in the Cloud 
### Crafted in the Go Programming language
####  Hosted on Bluemix and photos stored on (Swift based) Object Storage v2 service

Learn how to build a mobile compatible photo upload and storage webapp using the Go programming language.  Use the [Martini application framework](https://github.com/go-martini/martini) for backend and [jQuery mobile](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile) for UI.

Then deploy your app in the IBM Bluemix cloud, and have your photos archived privately onto Object Storage v2 service - a robust, highly available and scalable storage solution.

You can manage your uploaded photo using the IBM Cloud Management console (based on OpenStack Horizon).
